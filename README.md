- FEVO - Group ticketing solution
- Pricemaster - Dynamic pricing tool
- Live Analytics - Ticketing analytics platform
- TM1 - Reporting and analytics tool
- TM Entry - On-site ticket scanning
- Fortress - Access control system

**Customer Relationship Management**
- Archtics (Sybase) - Patron data from ticketing
- Raiser's Edge (SQL) - Donor management system

**Marketing Automation**

- Social Media Platforms - Engagement metrics
- Content Management Systems - Website management

## Key Challenges

Based on the complex systems landscape at Bethelwood, we're facing several data-related challenges:

1. **Fragmented Ticketing Ecosystem**: Multiple ticketing-related systems (Ticketmaster, Archtics, FEVO, Pricemaster, etc.) creating fragmented customer views and making reporting a headache

2. **Disconnected Marketing Systems**: Email (TM Engage, Raiser's Edge) and SMS (TapOnIt) platforms working separately without unified customer engagement tracking

3. **Siloed Operational Data**: Critical operational systems (E-Maint, Zendesk, Survey platforms, Yellow Dog inventory) functioning as standalone solutions with minimal integration

4. **Disparate POS Environment**: Different POS systems (Square, Clover) for various sales channels creating messy sales reporting

5. **Limited Cross-System Analytics**: No unified analytics framework across ticketing, fundraising, marketing, and operations creating blind spots in understanding the customer journey

6. **Manual Reporting Processes**: Time-consuming manual data extraction and consolidation across multiple systems (ugh!)

7. **Incomplete Customer Profiles**: Customer/donor data split between Archtics and Raiser's Edge without a comprehensive unified view

8. **Measurement Gaps**: Not enough integration between program activities and outcome measurement for mission impact reporting

9. **Limited Data Governance**: Lack of standardized data definitions, quality controls, and master data management across systems

10. **Technical Complexity**: Diverse technology stack with varying database platforms (Sybase, SQL, MySQL, Android OS, proprietary systems) making integration tricky
