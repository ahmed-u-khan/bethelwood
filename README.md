## Executive Summary

This data strategy lays out a game-changing approach for Bethelwood to harness its data assets, break down those pesky silos, and create an integrated analytics ecosystem that drives mission-focused outcomes. By rolling out a modern data stack architecture, we'll gain scalability, flexibility, and beefed-up analytical capabilities to support both operational excellence and meaningful impact measurement. The strategy tackles immediate needs while building a foundation for future growth, setting Bethelwood up to leverage data as a strategic asset in fulfilling its cultural and educational mission.

---

## Strategic Context

Bethelwood stands at a pivotal moment after years of growth in visitation and programming. To fully leverage this momentum, we need a cohesive data strategy that:
- Connects our currently siloed information systems
- Turns raw data into actionable insights
- Enables data-driven decision making across all departments
- Shows and communicates our mission impact to stakeholders
- Supports growth initiatives while maintaining cultural integrity
- Enhances visitor experiences through smarter, data-informed programming

## Current State Assessment

### Data Systems Inventory

The following systems make up Bethelwood's current tech landscape, organized by functional area:

**Ticketing Ecosystem**
- Ticketmaster/Archtics (Sybase) - Primary ticketing system
- Ticketmaster One (Snowflake) - Next-gen ticketing platform
- FEVO - Group ticketing solution
- Pricemaster - Dynamic pricing tool
- Live Analytics - Ticketing analytics platform
- TM1 - Reporting and analytics tool
- TM Entry - On-site ticket scanning
- Fortress - Access control system

**Customer Relationship Management**
- Archtics (Sybase) - Patron data from ticketing
- Raiser's Edge (SQL) - Donor management system

**Marketing Automation**
- TM Engage - Email marketing for ticket buyers
- Raiser's Edge - Email communications for donors
- TapOnIt - SMS marketing platform

**Point of Sale**
- Square - Primary concessions and retail POS
- Clover (Android OS) - Museum store POS
- Square - Concert merchandise POS

**Operational Systems**
- E-Maint - Facility maintenance management
- Zendesk (MySQL) - Customer service ticketing

- Yellow Dog - Inventory management system
- Campspot (MySQL) - Camping reservations

**Web and Social** (assumed)
- Google Analytics - Website analytics
- Social Media Platforms - Engagement metrics
- Content Management Systems - Website management

## Key Challenges

Based on the complex systems landscape at Bethelwood, we're facing several data-related challenges:

1. **Fragmented Ticketing Ecosystem**: Multiple ticketing-related systems (Ticketmaster, Archtics, FEVO, Pricemaster, etc.) creating fragmented customer views and making reporting a headache

2. **Disconnected Marketing Systems**: Email (TM Engage, Raiser's Edge) and SMS (TapOnIt) platforms working separately without unified customer engagement tracking

3. **Siloed Operational Data**: Critical operational systems (E-Maint, Zendesk, Survey platforms, Yellow Dog inventory) functioning as standalone solutions with minimal integration

4. **Disparate POS Environment**: Different POS systems (Square, Clover) for various sales channels creating messy sales reporting

5. **Limited Cross-System Analytics**: No unified analytics framework across ticketing, fundraising, marketing, and operations creating blind spots in understanding the customer journey

6. **Manual Reporting Processes**: Time-consuming manual data extraction and consolidation across multiple systems (ugh!)

7. **Incomplete Customer Profiles**: Customer/donor data split between Archtics and Raiser's Edge without a comprehensive unified view

8. **Measurement Gaps**: Not enough integration between program activities and outcome measurement for mission impact reporting

9. **Limited Data Governance**: Lack of standardized data definitions, quality controls, and master data management across systems

10. **Technical Complexity**: Diverse technology stack with varying database platforms (Sybase, SQL, MySQL, Android OS, proprietary systems) making integration tricky
